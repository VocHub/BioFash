## **Aim**
The recent rise in conversation surrounding the environmental impact 
and ethical business practices of the fashion industry has given rise to new 
terminolgy such as "Fast Fashion" and "Sustainable Fashion" to describe different aspects 
and practices of the fashion industry.

With that in mind I decided to build this website to help people gain a better understanding of what these
terms mean, the effects of Fast Fashion, and how Sustainable Fashion can help to counteract 
the impact it is having on the planet. Also to build awareness on the subject and to inspire users 
to make more sustainable choices in a fun and engaging way.

#### **Business Goals**
- Define Fast Fashion and give users a better understanding of what it means
- Highlight and raise awareness of the environmental and ethical impact of Fast Fashion
- To promote sustainability in the fashion industry
- To encourage users to think about impact of the choices they make when shopping for fashion
- To encourage users to change the way they shop to lessen the impact on the planet
- To offer tangible alternatives to users

### **Issues and Resolutions**
The following issues were identified and rectified during the build process.

- Background images not displaying:
   - File path was incorrect

- Collapse icon on navbar not displaying on mobile screen sizes:    
   - Although the icon was there and clickable the burger icon was not displaying.
   - Resolved by adding the ```navbar-dark```  to the navbar class.

-  When navbar dropdown menu was activated and link clicked, the menu didn't collapse up again:
   - Resolved by adding ```data-toggle="collapse" data-target=".navbar-collapse.show"``` to each list item

- Cards in the Events section pushing down below background image and overlapping the sections below it on smaller screen sizes:
   - Resolved by removing set ```height: 100vh``` on background image

- The Facts section not displaying correctly at tablet screen size:
   - Resolved by changing column width from ```col-md-6``` to ```col-lg-6```

- Images and paragraphs in The Facts section not displaying in the desired order:
   - Resolved by adding Bootstrap **order class** - ```order-lg-2``` & ```order-lg-1``` to relevant images and paragraphs

- When I ran [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) it indicated that some of the images were increasing the load time of the page.
   - Reduced image file sizes to decrease load time

- On extra large widescreen (&#8805;1500px) the text in the facts section was hugging the top of the <div>
   - Media query added to push down content at that screen size

- Heading in Welcome section not rendering correctly on Internet Explorer:
   - Not yet resolved
